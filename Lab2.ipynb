Because the teams were ranked based on the number of points they scored in total, ordinary bar charts would not have displayed the necessary information properly without these bars on top of one another and in a specific order. They are ranked according to their total points scored, therefore, the team with the highest, being Arizona, sits on the top of the chart and from there, the numbers slowly, diminish. Different colors are not 100% necessary in this case as the graph is perfectly understood with one singular color being used. The main point of the data is highlighted by the graph itself and since there is a vast amount of data for this particular graph, keeping it simple is vital."

Because of this significant difference, conclusions may be drawn- perhaps the Animalia kingdom itself is much larger than the Plantae or maybe winning teams choose similar mascots unintentionally. A legend is provided even though the graph itself is rather simple."
